# Sandbox

This repository is my sandbox to play around with nifty tools/libraries/etc.

## Build system
The repo uses a python-automated CMake build system. From the repository root
directory, run `python autobuild.py <directory>` to build it and `python
autoclean.py <directory>` to clean it. Both scripts have help dialogues to
assist with additional command line arguments.
